Think of it like the blueprint for a house; the blueprint itself isn't the house, but you can build many houses based on that blueprint.\n","\n","## Q3.What is an object in OOP?\n","- In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created from the class blueprint, containing its own specific data (attributes) and capable of performing the actions (methods) defined by the class. Think of the houses built from the blueprint – each house is an object.\n","\n","## Q4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n","- In short, **Abstraction** focuses on *what* an object does (hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features), while **Encapsulation** focuses on *how* an object's data and methods are bundled together and protected (bundling data and methods within a class and controlling access to the data).\n","\n","Q5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n","\n","- Dunder methods (or magic methods) in Python are special methods with names starting and ending with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__). They allow you to emulate the behavior of built-in types and operators.\n","\n","Q6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n","- Inheritance is a mechanism in OOP that allows a new class (child or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (parent or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n","\n","Q7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n","- Polymorphism in OOP means \"many forms\". It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means a single function or method can work with objects of different types, as long as they share a common interface or inherited method.\n","\n","Q8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n","- Encapsulation in Python is typically achieved by bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit, the class. While Python doesn't have strict private access modifiers like some other languages, you can indicate that an attribute or method is intended for internal use by prefixing its name with a single underscore (convention) or double underscores (name mangling).\n","\n","Q9.What is a constructor in Python?\n","- In Python, a constructor is a special method named __init__. It's automatically called when you create a new object (an instance) of a class. Its main purpose is to initialize the object's attributes.\n","\n","Q10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n","- Class methods are bound to the class and receive the class itself as the first argument (conventionally named cls). They are often used for factory methods or to access/modify class state.\n","- Static methods are not bound to either the class or the instance. They are like regular functions but are defined within a class. They don't have access to the instance or class and are often used for utility functions related to the class\n","\n","Q11.What is method overloading in Python?\n","- Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods within the same class that have the same name but different parameters. Python does not support traditional method overloading based on the number or type of parameters like some other languages. The last defined method with the same name will override previous definitions.\n","\n"," Q12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n"," -Method overriding is a feature of OOP where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass has the same name, parameters, and return type (or compatible type) as the method in the superclass\n","\n"," Q13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n"," - The @property decorator in Python provides a way to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. It's commonly used to create \"getters\" and \"setters\" for attributes, allowing you to control how attribute values are accessed and modified.\n","\n"," Q14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n"," - Polymorphism is important because it allows for greater flexibility and extensibility in code. It enables you to write more generic code that can work with objects of different types, making your programs easier to maintain, modify, and extend without needing to change the underlying code.\n","\n"," Q15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n"," - An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes that cannot be instantiated itself. It's used to define a common interface for a set of subclasses and often contains one or more abstract methods (methods declared but not implemented in the abstract class), which must be implemented by the subclasses.\n","\n"," Q16.What are the advantages of OOP?\n"," - advantages of OOP include:\n","\n","- Modularity: Objects can be self-contained units, making code easier to manage and understand.\n","- Reusability: Inheritance allows you to reuse code from existing classes.\n","- Flexibility: Polymorphism enables writing more generic and adaptable code.\n","- Maintainability: Encapsulation and modularity make it easier to update and debug code.\n","- Scalability: OOP design principles can help manage complexity in large projects.\n","\n","Q17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n","- Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside of any instance method.\n","- Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within the constructor (__init__) or other instance methods, usually using self..\n","\n","Q18.What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n","- Multiple inheritance is a feature in Python where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a class to combine functionalities from multiple sources.\n","\n","Q19.Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n","- __str__ is used to provide a human-readable string representation of an object, typically for end-users.\n","__repr__ is used to provide an unambiguous string representation of an object, typically for developers, which could be used to recreate the object.\n","\n","Q20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n","- The super() function in Python is used to call a method from a parent or grandparent class. It's commonly used in inheritance to access methods of the superclass, particularly in the __init__ method of a subclass to ensure the parent class is properly initialized.\n","\n","Q21.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n","- The __del__ method in Python is a destructor. It is called when an object's reference count becomes zero, meaning it's no longer being used and is about to be garbage collected. It's typically used for cleanup tasks, like closing file handles or network connections. However, its execution is not guaranteed, so it's generally not the preferred way to manage resources.\n","\n","Q22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n","- @classmethod methods are bound to the class and receive the class itself as the first argument (conventionally named cls). They are often used for factory methods or to access/modify class state.\n","- @staticmethod methods are not bound to either the class or the instance. They are like regular functions but are defined within a class. They don't have access to the instance or class and are often used for utility functions related to the class.\n","\n","Q23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n","- In Python, polymorphism with inheritance works by allowing a child class to override methods defined in its parent class. When you call a method on an object, Python determines which version of the method to execute based on the object's actual type at runtime. This allows you to use a single interface (the method name) to perform different actions depending on the object's class.\n","\n","Q24.What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n","- Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where you call multiple methods on an object in a single statement. This is possible when each method returns the object itself (self), allowing the next method call to be made on the result of the previous one. It often makes code more readable and concise\n","\n","Q25.What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n","- The __call__ method in Python allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When you define this method in a class, you can use the object's name followed by parentheses (()) to execute the code inside the __call__ method."]}]}
